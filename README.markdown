BaseLookAndFeel
===============

Generates a layout (`application.html.erb`) and stylesheet (`application.css`) that look respectable.  These are intended to be a good, semantic base on which to build your application-specific look and feel.

The CSS uses a few icons and these are copies to your `/public/images/icons/` directory.

This plugin works well with the [AirBuddFormBuilder plugin][1] which generates forms as recommended by [Andy Budd][2] and [Kevin Hale][3].
